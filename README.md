## Editing ##

These icons were created with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and if you're modifying them you will probably want to edit the .svg files yourself.  You can find them in the `svg/` directory.

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is probably in your package manager.  A simple `sudo apt-get install inkscape` or `sudo dnf install inkscape` should get you set up most Linux distros.  To install it on OSX you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and a `brew cask install inkscape`.

## Icons ##

There are pre-exported icons under `.png` that are suitable for importing into Slack.
